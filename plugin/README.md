# Code4Me - VSC Extension

<!-- Plugin description -->
**Code4Me** provides language model based code completion. Code4Me predicts statement (line) completion and is seemlessly integrated with Visual Studio Code's code completion. The code suggestions from Code4Me are denoted with a unicode "&#10094; &#65295; &#10095;" representation of the logo.

For more information, visit the [Code4Me](https://code4me.me) website.
